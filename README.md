# 📊 User Profiling & Segmentation using Python

This project replicates the tutorial from [The Clever Programmer](https://thecleverprogrammer.com/2024/02/26/user-profiling-and-segmentation-using-python/) to perform **user profiling and segmentation** using Python. The workflow covers loading user activity data, performing clustering (using KMeans), and visualizing distinct user segments with radar charts.

## 🚀 Features

* User segmentation using **KMeans clustering**
* Data normalization and feature scaling
* Interactive **radar chart visualization** with Plotly
* Useful for marketing personas, customer profiling, and behavioral segmentation

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

* **Python 3**
* **Pandas** for data manipulation
* **Scikit-learn** for clustering
* **Plotly** for interactive visualization
* **Matplotlib** (optional) for additional plots

## 📂 Project Structure

```
├── user-profiling-and-segmentation-using-python  # Jupyter Notebook with full code and outputs
├── user_profiles_for_ads.csv                 
└── README.md                # This file
```

## 📈 Segments Identified

The clustering process groups users into segments such as:

* **Weekend Warriors**
* **Engaged Professionals**
* **Low-Key Users**
* **Active Explorers**
* **Budget Browsers**

## 📝 How to Run

1. **Clone the repo (or download the notebook):**

   ```bash
   git clone <your-repo-url>
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**

   ```bash
   pip install pandas scikit-learn plotly matplotlib
   ```

3. **Run the notebook:**
   Open `user-profiling-and-segmentation-using-python` in Jupyter Notebook or VSCode and execute the cells step by step.

## 📊 Example Output

* ✅ KMeans clusters assigned to each user
* ✅ Interactive **radar chart** comparing user segments
* ✅ Feature importance and user behavior profiles
